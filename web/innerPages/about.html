                    IFTTT is a free web-based service that allows users to create chains of simple conditional statements,
                    called "recipes", which are triggered based on changes to other web services such as Gmail, Facebook,
                    Instagram, and Pinterest. IFTTT is an abbreviation of "If This Then That".

                    <br>
                    An example "recipe" might consist of sending an e-mail message if the IFTTT user tweets using a certain
                    hashtag. Or, if the user is tagged by someone on Facebook, then that photo will be added to the user's
                    cloud-based photo archive.
